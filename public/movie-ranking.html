<h2>3 albums to know if you want to have a well-rounded taste in alternative Hip Hop</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Deltron 3030</h3>
<p>This is a journey through a futuristic dystopia. Del tha funkee Homosapien and Dan the Automator create a concept album that uses sci-fi to talk about how our technological progress will always be in conjunction with ever-present issues in this world.</p>
<h3>Enter the 36 Chambers</h3>
<p>Wu-Tang is raw. Telling the stories of a people that are exploited for stereotypical images, but telling it with some of that real. They mix together their love for martial arts films and their everyday experience in New York's Staten Island. The beats punch you in the face, and their flow spits on conventions of the rap game.</p>
<h3>3 Feet High and Rising</h3>
<p>De La Soul means "from the soul", and they carry that with them through this album. It's some positive hippie-rap about living life with fun while sharing some earnest philosophies. Skits with contestants on a game show bring some humor and commentary on a silly capitalist society we all live in. New perspectives and a sense of humor.</p>
